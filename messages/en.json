Holders can interact with these characters through the Nobody App, understanding their personalities, hobbies, backgrounds and shaping their future. <br></br><br></br>We also strive to build the Nobody IP, combining Mr. Stephen Chow's previous experience and new mechanisms.

We will also actively build on the Nobody IP in various forms. What’s more, Nobody will seek to expand into more fields, such as fashion, art, music, etc., to call upon every nobody and co-create quality content for both Web2 and Web3."
